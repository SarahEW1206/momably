This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## TO-DOs:

- [ ] Format/style the profile pages
- [ ] Figure out how to sort results alpha by biz name
- [ ] Figure out how to prevent updating profile w/ an email already in use.

- [x] Format list-view rows in marketplace (good enough for now)
- [x] Add all account fields to Edit Profile page.
- [x] Update all links with process.env.PUBLIC_URL!! (otherwise they will not work in prod)
- [x] HOW TO PREVENT 404 ON DIRECT LINK OR PAGE RELOAD (ANYWHERE BUT HOME) ON GH PAGES? [Used this from rafrex on github](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).
